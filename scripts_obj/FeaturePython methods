execute(self, obj)	                在文档重新计算期间调用	Do not call recompute() from this method (or any method called from execute()) as this causes a nested recompute.
onBeforeChange(self, obj, prop)	    在更改属性值之前调用	prop is the name of the property to be changed, not the property object itself. Property changes cannot be cancelled. Previous / next property values are not simultaneously available for comparison.
onChanged(self, obj, prop)	        在属性更改后调用	prop is the name of the property to be changed, not the property object itself.
onDocumentRestored(self, obj)	    Called after a document is restored or a FeaturePython object is copied.	Occasionally, references to the FeaturePython object from the class, or the class from the FeaturePython object may be broken, as the class __init__() method is not called when the object is reconstructed. Adding self.Object = obj or obj.Proxy = self often solves these issues.
